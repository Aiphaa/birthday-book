    <p>
      Ayayay, i have never even dared to imagine that one day I will write something about someone 
      but here I am doing it proudly and insanely happy about it.<br><br>

      It all started in November the 10th, I sent a friend request to a Raze player who was helping me 
      defending my site, I didn‚Äôt know that this girl will be the love of my life and the most person 
      I will ever care about. From the first DM I felt that we would be great friends, you weren‚Äôt trying 
      to seek attention nor be ‚Äúa pick me‚Äú like most of the discord/gamer girls are these days, you were 
      being yourself and talking to me like we know each other for a long time, and somehow, I found myself 
      doing the same after I saw the Ismail in you.<br><br>

      I did feel the sadness you were going through back then and it made me have the urge to help you to 
      get out of that and make you enjoy life a bit more, though I have to admit that I didn‚Äôt care about 
      your feelings that much because I did treat you like a ‚Äúhomie‚Äù, and that caused us a lot of problems 
      at first because we were very different in how we see things; you were an emotional soul and I was just 
      a selfish heartless guy who took everything as a joke and couldn‚Äôt care less about how my friends feel 
      as long as I am having fun and happy with my life.<br><br>

      The obvious next step here was us to stop being friends because we just couldn‚Äôt match in these things, 
      but guess what happened; you didn‚Äôt give up on the friendship and you showed me how much you cared and 
      how much you were attached to me, and that made me realize that despite me being selfish I also wouldn‚Äôt 
      give up on what we had. And that‚Äôs when I decided to change and start acknowledging your feelings more 
      in order to not hurt you anymore.<br><br>

      You made me a better person Martina, because of you, I am not that old heartless version of me anymore, 
      You have no idea how much I appreciate that and how much I am willing to do for you just to see you happy 
      in your life not needing anything from anyone anymore.<br><br>

      You are the best thing that ever happened to me and I could never afford to lose you, so deal with it and 
      accept the fact that you will be with me for the rest of your life and that nothing can break us apart.<br><br>

      So, I say this proudly, I love you Martina ƒÜavar, and I want the whole world to know that you are the best girl 
      ever existed and that I won in life by having you.<br><br>

      Happy birthday amoririiiiiiiiii ‚ù§Ô∏è
